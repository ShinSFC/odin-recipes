        <h2>Drunken Mussels</h2>
        <p>One of the fastest shellfish dishes. Amazing wine-based flavor that should be served with grilled bread to soak up every last drop of broth!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 cups white wine</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds mussels, cleaned and debearded</li>
            <li> 1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add garlic and let sizzle for about 30 seconds. Stir in lemon zest and red pepper flakes for about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Quickly pour wine into the pot and season with black pepper. Bring sauce to a boil. Add mussels and cover immediately. Shake pot and let boil for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir mussels, replace cover, and let boil for 2 more minutes. The shells will begin to open. Stir in parsley, cover, and cook until all shells are open, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
